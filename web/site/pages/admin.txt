Setup and Administration
========================

Prerequisites
-------------

The following instructions assume you are using a Linux machine, and
will be similar on a Mac.  If you have a Windows machine, you will
probably want to install Cygwin to get a Unix-like command line.

You will need a few packages installed on your machine if they are not
already installed.  On Linux

    sudo apt-get install coffeescript

If you get an error about something not being found in the
instructions below, installing the missing package with `apt-get` or
the appropriate package manager for your platform.

Download
--------

Download or fork from <https://github.com/eobrain/glan> 

You should end up with a directory with a file called `Makefile`. To
run s server locally open a shell, `cd` to that directory and execute

    make server

Then visit <http://localhost:4444> in your browser
