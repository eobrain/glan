Markdown
========

Markdown is a simple text format for authoring basic web page text.
If you search on the web you will probably find many different guides
and tutorials for writing Markdown to supplement this simple guide.

Editing Tools
-------------

You need a simple text editor.  If you have a Windows PC, you can use
Wordpad which is included with Windows. (I do not recommend Notepad,
because it has problems with "line-endings" which can cause formatting
to mess up especially if you are sharing with people using Mac or
Linux.)

There are also some markdown-specific editors that you can download
and try if you will be editing a lot of pages.


Paragraphs
----------

You can type paragraphs just as you probably type e-mail, with a blank
line between paragraphs.

So for example I entered the two paragraphs in the previous section
like so:

    and try if you will be editing a lot of pages.

Headers
-------

You enter a main header by adding a row of equal signs under it.
There should only be one main header on each page and it should be at
the top.  So for example I entered the main header at the top of this
page like so:

    ========

You enter a sectiion header by adding a row of dashes under it.  So
for example, here is how I entered the first section header above:

Lists
-----

To make a bullet list simply add a asterisk before each item. So for
example:

    * Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
    * Nunc eget malesuada lacus.
    * Maecenas eu lobortis felis.

Gives:

* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
* Nunc eget malesuada lacus.
* Maecenas eu lobortis felis.

Numbered lists are similar, but using a number followed by a dot.  So
for example

    1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
    2. Nunc eget malesuada lacus.
    3. Maecenas eu lobortis felis.

Gives:

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Nunc eget malesuada lacus.
3. Maecenas eu lobortis felis.

Block Quote
-----------

You can block-quote some text by preceding each line with a
greater-than character.  So for example:

    > Proin feugiat, sapien et adipiscing elementum, sem diam feugiat
    > arcu, nec aliquet nunc lorem nec elit. Sed pellentesque ultricies
    > risus, sed mollis enim adipiscing at. Quisque congue faucibus odio.

Gives 

> Proin feugiat, sapien et adipiscing elementum, sem diam feugiat
> arcu, nec aliquet nunc lorem nec elit. Sed pellentesque ultricies
> risus, sed mollis enim adipiscing at. Quisque congue faucibus odio.

Emphasizing Text
----------------

Some words surrounded by single asterisk will appear *like this*,
while some words surrounded by two asterisks will appear **like
this**.

So for example I wrote the previous sentence like so:

    A some words surrounded by single asterisk will appear *like this*,
    while some words surrounded by two asterisks will appear **like
    this**.


Hyperlinks
----------

If you want to link to some other web page you put the name of the
page in square brackets followed by the URL of the page in
parentheses.  So for example:

    [Google](http://www.google.com)

gives

[Google](http://www.google.com)

If the page is another page on this web site then the URL can be
shortened to just the "#" character followed by the page ID.  So for
example

    [Features of Glan](#features)

gives

[Features of Glan](#features)

Images
------

The format for displaying an image is the same as a for a hyperlink,
except you add an exclamation mark before it.

So for example

    ![Pink Punk Castro Street Accordionist](http://farm1.staticflickr.com/112/257941125_f9aface69c_t_d.jpg)

gives 

![Pink Punk Castro Street Accordionist](http://farm1.staticflickr.com/112/257941125_f9aface69c_t_d.jpg)

The text in square brackets is generally invisible, but is important
for accessibility so that blind people using a screen reader will be
able to use your site.  The URL in parentheses is the link to the
image file.

But what if the image you want to show is not on the Web?  In that
case you can upload the image to somewhere under the "site" folder and
then link to it there, using just the local name.  For example, there
is an image called "2387534678_153f52cfc8_m.jpg" in this site, so

    ![Glan logo](site/2387534678_153f52cfc8_m.jpg)

gives

![Glan logo](site/2387534678_153f52cfc8_m.jpg)


Example Pages
-------------

You can look at the markdown of the pages on this site for some
examples

* [features.txt](site/pages/features.txt) is the markdown for
  [Features](#features) and contains a main header and a bullet list.
* [eamonn.txt](site/pages/eamonn.txt) is the markdown for
  [Eamonn O'Brien-Strain](#eamonn) and includes some paragraphs and hyperlinks
