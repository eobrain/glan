## Synchronizing with S3 to a Windows PC

If your administrator deployed your site on S3, then you must first copy the files to your local PC.

1. Download and install an S3 client such as [Cloudberry Explorer][1]
2. In the client, add an S3 account. Your administrator can give you the necessary _access key_ and _secret key_ and tell you which bucket contains the web site
3. Use the client to sync the bucket with a folder on your PC, pulling the files from the cloud
4. Edit the files as described in the next section.
5. Sync again to push your changes to the cloud.
6. The changes might not be immediately visible on the web site if your administrator has set up a content distribution network. To see your changes immediately look instead at the uncached URL for your S3 bucket which you administrator can give you. It will be a URL of the form http://_bucketname_.s3-website-_region_.amazonaws.com

## Editing Files

To modify an existing Glan web site. you will need to make changes as follows

1. Edit the file [site/config.json](site/config.json) to set the
title of the web site and other properties.
3. Edit the file [site/footer.txt](site/footer.txt) to set the
text that goes on the bottom of each page.
4. Edit the file [site/structure.json](site/structure.json) to
specify all the pages in your web site and how they are arranged
hierarchically.
5. For every entry in the `structure.json` add a `.txt` file in
[Markdown](#markdown) format in
[site/pages/](site/pages/). For example
[site/pages/home.txt](site/pages/home.txt) is the home page. 
6. Specify rotating images in [site/rotimg/](site/rotimg/)
